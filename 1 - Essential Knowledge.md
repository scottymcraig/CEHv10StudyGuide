    $$

**User Behavior Analysis** (UBA) - tracking users and extrapolating data in light of malicious activity

### <u>CIA Triad</u>

- **Confidentiality** - passwords, encryption
- **Integrity** - hashing, digital signatures
- **Availability** - anti-dos solutions

**Bit flipping** is an example of an <u>integrity</u> attack.  The outcome is not to gain information - it is to obscure the data from the actual user.

Confidentiality != authentication - MAC address spoofing is an authentication attack

### <u>Common Criterial for Information Technology Security Evaluation</u>

**Cyberterrorist** - motivated by religious or political beliefs to create fear or disruption

**State-Sponsored Hacker** - hacker that is hired by a government

### <u>Attack Types</u>

- **Operating System** (OS) - attacks targeting OS flaws or security issues inside such as guest accounts or default passwords

- **Shrink-Wrap Code** - attack takes advantage of built-in code or scripts
- **Misconfiguration** - attack takes advantage of systems that are misconfigured due to improper configuration or default configuration

**Infowar** - the use of offensive and defensive techniques to create an advantage

### <u>Hacking Phases</u>

1. **Reconnaissance**  - gathering evidence about targets
