# Scanning and Enumeration

**Scanning** - discovering systems on the network and looking at what ports are open as well as applications that may be running

**Connectionless Communication** - UDP packets are sent without creating a connection.  Examples are TFTP, DNS (lookups only) and DHCP

**Connection-Oriented Communication** - TCP packets require a connection due to the size of the data being transmitted and to ensure deliverability

### <u>TCP Flags</u>

| Flag | Name           | Function                                                     |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYN  | Synchronize    | Set during initial communication.  Negotiating of parameters and sequence numbers |
| ACK  | Acknowledgment | Set as an acknowledgement to the SYN flag.  Always set after initial SYN |
| RST  | Reset          | Forces the termination of a connection (in both directions)  |
| FIN  | Finish         | Ordered close to communications                              |
| PSH  | Push           | Forces the delivery of data without concern for buffering    |
| URG  | Urgent         | Data inside is being sent out of band.  Example is cancelling a message |

### <u>TCP Handshake</u>

- SYN -> SYN-ACK - ACK
- Sequence numbers increase on new communication.  Example is computers A and B.  A would increment B's sequence number.  A would never increment it's own sequence.

### <u>Port Numbers</u>

- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** (IANA) - maintains Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry which lists all port number reservations

- Ranges

  - **Well-known ports** - 0 - 1023

  - **Registered ports** - 1024 - 49,151

  - **Dynamic ports** - 49,152 - 65,535

    | Port Number | Protocol | Transport Protocol |
    | ----------- | -------- | ------------------ |
    | 20/21       | FTP      | TCP                |
    | 22          | SSH      | TCP                |
    | 23          | Telnet   | TCP                |
    | 25          | SMTP     | TCP                |
    | 53          | DNS      | TCP/UDP            |
    | 67          | DHCP     | UDP                |
    | 69          | TFTP     | UDP                |
    | 80          | HTTP     | TCP                |
    | 110         | POP3     | TCP                |
    | 135         | RPC      | TCP                |
    | 137-139     | NetBIOS  | TCP/UDP            |
    | 143         | IMAP     | TCP                |
    | 161/162     | SNMP     | UDP                |
    | 389         | LDAP     | TCP/UDP            |
    | 443         | HTTPS    | TCP                |
    | 445         | SMB      | TCP                |
    | 514         | SYSLOG   | UDP                |

  - A service is said to be **listening** for a port when it has that specific port open

  - Once a service has made a connection, the port is in an **established** state

  - Netstat

    - Shows open ports on computer
    - **netstat -an** displays connections in numerical form
    - **netstat -b** displays executables tied to the open port (admin only)

### <u>Subnetting</u>

- **IPv4 Main Address Types**
  - **Unicast** - acted on by a single recipient
  - **Multicast** - acted on by members of a specific group
  - **Broadcast** - acted on by everyone on the network
    - **Limited** - delivered to every system in the domain (255.255.255.255)
    - **Directed** - delivered to all devices on a subnet and use that broadcast address
- **Subnet mask** - determines how many address available on a specific subnet
  - Represented by three methods
    - **Decimal** - 255.240.0.0
    - **Binary** - 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000
    - **CIDR** - x.x.x.x/12   (where x.x.x.x is an ip address on that range)
  - If all the bits in the host field are 1s, the address is the broadcast
  - If they are all 0s, it's the network address
  - Any other combination indicates an address in the range

### <u>Scanning Methodology</u>

- **Check for live systems** - ping or other type of way to determine live hosts
- **Check for open ports** - once you know live host IPs, scan them for listening ports
- **Scan beyond IDS** - if needed, use methods to scan  beyond the detection systems
- **Perform banner grabbing** - grab from servers as well as perform OS fingerprinting
- **Scan for vulnerabilities** - use tools to look at the vulnerabilities of open systems
- **Draw network diagrams** - shows logical and physical pathways into networks
- **Prepare proxies** - obscures efforts to keep you hidden

### <u>Identifying Targets</u>

- The easiest way to scan for live systems is through ICMP.

- It has it's shortcomings and is sometimes blocked on hosts that are actually live.

- **Message Types and Returns**

  | ICMP Message Type           | Description and Codes                                        |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 0:  Echo Reply              | Answer to a Type 8 Echo Request                              |
  | 3:  Destination Unreachable | Error message followed by these codes:<br />0 - Destination network unreachable<br />1 - Destination host unreachable<br />6 - Network unknown<br />7 - Host unknown<br />9 - Network administratively prohibited<br />10 - Host administratively prohibited<br />13 - Communication administratively prohibited |
  | 4: Source Quench            | A congestion control message                                 |
  | 5: Redirect                 | Sent when there are two or more gateways available for the sender to use.  Followed by these codes:<br />0 - Redirect datagram for the network<br />1 - Redirect datagram for the host |
  | 8:  Echo Request            | A ping message, requesting an echo reply                     |
  | 11:  Time Exceeded          | Packet took too long to be routed (code 0 is TTL expired)    |

  - Payload of an ICMP message can be anything; RFC never set what it was supposed to be.  Allows for covert channels
  - **Ping sweep** - easiest method to identify hosts
  - **ICMP Echo scanning** - sending an ICMP Echo Request to the network IP address
  - An ICMP return of type 3 with a code of 13 indicates a poorly configured firewall
  - **Ping scanning tools**
    - Nmap
    - Angry IP Scanner
    - Solar-Winds Engineer Toolkit
    - Advanced IP Scanner
    - Pinkie
  - Nmap virtually always does a ping sweep with scans unless you turn it off

### <u>Port Scan Types</u>

- **Full connect** - TCP connect or full open scan - full connection and then tears down with RST
  - Easiest to detect, but most reliable
  - nmap -sT
- **Stealth** - half-open scan or SYN scan - only SYN packets sent.  Responses same as full.
  - Useful for hiding efforts and evading firewalls
  - nmap -sS
- **Inverse TCP flag** - uses FIN, URG or PSH flag.  Open gives no response.  Closed gives RST/ACK
  - nmap -sN (Null scan)
  - nmap -sF (FIN scan)
- **Xmas** - so named because all flags are turned on so it's "lit up" like a Christmas tree
  - Responses are same as Inverse TCP scan
  - Do not work against Windows machines
  - nmap -sX
- **ACK flag probe** - multiple methods
  - TTL version - if TTL of RST packet < 64, port is open
  - Window version - if the Window on the RST packet is anything other than 0, port open
  - Can be used to check filtering.  If ACK is sent and no response, stateful firewall present.
  - nmap -sA (ACK scan)
  - nmap -sW (Window scan)
- **IDLE Scan** - uses a third party to check if a port is open
  - Looks at the IPID to see if there is a response
  - Only works if third party isn't transmitting data
  - Sends a request to the third party to check IPID id; then sends a spoofed packet to the target with a return of the third party; sends a request to the third party again to check if IPID increased.
    - IPID increase of 1 indicates port closed
    - IPID increase of 2 indicates port open
    - IPID increase of anything greater indicates the third party was not idle
  - nmap -sI <zombie host>

### <u>Evasion</u>

- To evade IDS, sometimes you need to change the way you scan
- One method is to fragment packets (nmap -f switch)
- **OS Fingerprinting**
  - **Active**  - sending crafted packets to the target
  - **Passive** - sniffing network traffic for things such as TTL windows, DF flags and ToS fields
- **Spoofing** - can only be used when you don't expect a response back to your machine
- **Source routing** - specifies the path a packet should take on the network; most systems don't allow this anymore
- **IP Address Decoy** - sends packets from your IP as well as multiple other decoys to confuse the IDS/Firewall as to where the attack is really coming from
  - nmap -D RND:10 x.x.x.x
  - nmap -D decoyIP1,decoyIP2....,sourceIP,.... [target]
- **Proxy** - hides true identity by filtering through another computer.  Also can be used for other purposes such as content blocking evasion, etc.
  - **Proxy chains** - chaining multiple proxies together
    - Proxy Switcher
    - Proxy Workbench
    - ProxyChains
- **Tor** - a specific type of proxy that uses multiple hops to a destination; endpoints are peer computers
- **Anonymizers** - hides identity on HTTP traffic (port 80)

### <u>Vulnerability Scanning</u>

- Can be complex or simple tools run against a target to determine vulnerabilities
- Industry standard is Tenable's Nessus
- Other options include
  - GFI LanGuard
  - Qualys
  - FreeScan - best known for testing websites and applications
  - OpenVAS - best competitor to Nessus and is free

### <u>Enumeration</u>

- Defined as listing the items that are found within a specific target
- Always is active in nature

### <u>Windows System Basics</u>

- Everything runs within context of an account
- **Security Context** - user identity and authentication information
- **Security Identifier** (SID) - identifies a user, group or computer account
- **Resource Identifier** (RID) - portion of the SID identifying a specific user, group or computer
- The end  of the SID indicates the user number
  - Example SID:  S-1-5-21-3874928736-367528774-1298337465-**500**
  - **Administrator Account** - SID of 500
  - **Regular Accounts** - start with a SID of 1000
  - **Linux Systems** used user IDs (UID) and group IDs (GID).  Found in /etc/passwd
- **SAM Database** - file where all local passwords are stored (encrypted)
  - Stored in C:\Windows\System32\Config
- **Linux Enumeration Commands**
  - **finger** - info on user and host machine
  - **rpcinfo and rpcclient** - info on RPC in the environment
  - **showmount** - displays all shared directories on the machine

### <u>Banner Grabbing</u>

- **Active** - sending specially crafted packets and comparing responses to determine OS
- **Passive** - reading error messages, sniffing traffic or looking at page extensions
- Easy way to banner grab is connect via telnet on port (e.g. 80 for web server)
- **Netcat** can also be used to banner grab
  - nc <IPaddress or FQDN> <port number>
- Can be used to get information about OS or specific server info (such as web server, mail server, etc.)

### <u>NetBIOS Enumeration</u>

- NetBIOS provides name servicing, connectionless communication and some Session layer stuff
- The browser service in Windows designed to host information about all machines within domain or TCP/IP network segment
- NetBIOS name is a **16-character ASCII string** used to identify devices
- Command on Windows is **nbtstat**
  - nbtstat (gives your own info)
  - nbtstat -n (gives local table)
  - nbtstat -A IPADDRESS (gives remote information)
  - nbtstat -c (gives cache information)

| Code | Type   | Meaning                   |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| <1B> | UNIQUE | Domain master browser     |
| <1C> | UNIQUE | Domain controller         |
| <1D> | GROUP  | Master browser for subnet |
| <00> | UNIQUE | Hostname                  |
| <00> | GROUP  | Domain name               |
| <03> | UNIQUE | Service running on system |
| <20> | UNIQUE | Server service running    |

- NetBIOS name resolution doesn't work on IPv6
- **Other Tools**
  - SuperScan
  - Hyena
  - NetBIOS Enumerator
  - NSAuditor

### <u>SNMP Enumeration</u>

- **Management Information Base** (MIB) - database that stores information
- **Object Identifiers** (OID) - identifiers for information stored in MIB
- **SNMP GET** - gets information about the system
- **SNMP SET** - sets information about the system
- **Types of objects**
  - **Scalar** - single object
  - **Tabular** - multiple related objects that can be grouped together
- SNMP uses community strings which function as passwords
- There is a read-only and a read-write version

- These are sent in cleartext unless using SNMP v3
- **Tools**
  - Engineer's Toolset
  - SNMPScanner
  - OpUtils 5
  - SNScan
